      <h3>Orgnization</h3>
      <pre>
        Organized is the key to SUCCESS! To be successful on a daily basis, it
        is essential that most things are accounted for ahead of time. For
        parents, it is can be immensely frustrating when one cannot find the car
        keys, wallet, or any other essential items prior to leaving the house.
        For this reason, it is always place and replace these essential items in
        the same place.
      </pre>
        In turn, most major things are accounted the evening prior to heading to
        school. In the event, that one wakes up later than usual, it does not
        become a race against time. In turn, one leaves the house at ease and
        does not have to mitigate any actions behind the wheel that are
        ordinarily the result of being in a hurry.

      <h3>Planning</h3>
      Things can get become very heated when kids do not have their backpacks
      ready in time to head to school. The same goes for parents that do not
      seem to account for the repetitive things they do on a daily basisi. In
      relation to kids, please ensure that their backpacks are ready the evening
      prior to the school day. The same goes for making sure kids know which
      clothes they are planning on working wearing the following day.
      <br />
      <h3>Define Tasks And Set Time Limits</h3>
      A Commercial Driver is expected to perform different tasks while ensuring
      that the completion date and time of the main task: to deliver the load to
      customers, on time. Some of the daily tasks, a commercial is required to
      perform: perform a pre-trip, fuel, take a 30-minute break, account for
      distance travelled and time spent driving, etc. By the end of the day, the
      distance travelled will determine how many hours are left to complete the
      task. At the same time, fueling can take at least 20 minutes, without
      waiting for an available fuel lane. A flat tire can take hours to replace,
      whereas the consequences of oversleeping can result in termination of
      <p>

      </p>
      In order to remain constent and perform well, it is important to account
      for the time spent on individual tasks. As a Commercial Driver, "lunch
      breaks" shouild not exceed 30 minutes because a driver is only allowed to
      driver for up to 11 hours within a 14 hour perriod. The end time is
      non-negotiable and goes into effect exactly 14 hours after commencing work
      for the day. Needless to say, one needs to plan where to stop for the
      night to get the proper rest break in addition to being near a proper
      truck stop where on can take a shower and use the facilities.
      <br />
      Similar to a Commercial Driver, one should account for the time spent on
      different tasks, whether this is related to spending to on social media,
      cooking, or perfoming any of the other choices of possible tasks.
      <br />
      <h3>Do Not Make Up for "Lost" Time</h3>
      The main lesson to keep in mind is that it is not possible to make up for
      lost time, because one can only perform tasks more efficiently or less
      efficiently. Time management is, thereofore, a better term. When
      performing the same number of tasks within tighter time constraints, many
      things can go differently from time anticipated. This is especially true
      while driving, as the costs of making mistakes can result in far greatere
      consequences.
      <br />
      <br />
      Instead, account for tasks that cannot be feasibly performed woithin the
      allotted time frame, and leave them out when possible. The main idea is to
      get from A to B safely.
