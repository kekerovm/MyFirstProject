  <p>How To Combine Responsibilities Of Being A Commercial Driver With Daily Life!</p>
  <p>This webpage serves as a guide to incorporating the responsbilities of a commercial driver in order to become a professional at effectively managing the challenges of daily life/p>
    <h2>Keys To Success:</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
    Be Organized
    Plan Ahead
    Define Tasks And Set Time Linits
    Do Not Make Up For "Lost" Time
    Remain Consistent</p>
    <br>
    <br>
  <h3>Be Orgnized</h3>
  <p>Organized is the key to SUCCESS! To be successful on a daily basis, it is essential that most things are accounted for ahead of time. For parents, it is
    can be immensely frustrating when one cannot find the car keys, wallet, or any other essential items prior to leaving the house. For this reason, it is
    always place and replace these essential items in the same place. 
    <br>
    In turn, most major things are accounted the evening prior to heading to school. In the event, that one wakes up later than usual, it does not become a 
    race against time. In turn, one leaves the house at ease and does not have to mitigate any actions behind the wheel that are ordinarily the result of being
    in a hurry.

    <h3>PLan Ahead</h3>
    <br>
<p>Things can get become very heated when kids do not have their backpacks ready in time to head to school. The same goes for parents that do not seem to account 
  for the repetitive things they do on a daily basisi. In relation to kids, please ensure that their backpacks are ready the evening prior to the school day. The 
  same goes for making sure kids know which clothes they are planning on working
  wearing the following day.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>Define Tasks And Set Time Limits</h3>
  A Commercial Driver is expected to perform different tasks while ensuring that the completion date and time of the main task: to deliver the load to customers, 
  on time.
  Some of the daily tasks, a commercial is required to perform: perform a pre-trip, fuel, take a 30-minute break, account for distance travelled and time spent 
  driving, etc. By the end of the day, the distance travelled will determine how many hours are left to complete the task. At the same time, fueling can take at 
  least 20 minutes, without waiting for an available fuel lane. A flat tire can take hours to replace, whereas the consequences of oversleeping can result in 
  termination of employment.
  <br>
  In order to remain constent and perform well, it is important to account for the time spent on individual tasks. As a Commercial Driver, "lunch breaks" shouild 
  not exceed 30 minutes because a driver is only allowed to driver for up to 11 hours within a 14 hour perriod. The end time is non-negotiable and goes into effect
  exactly 14 hours after commencing work for the day. Needless to say, one needs to plan where to stop for the night to get the proper rest break in addition to 
  being near a proper truck stop where on can take a shower and use the facilities.
  <br>
  Similar to a Commercial Driver, one should account for the time spent on different tasks, whether this is related to spending to on social media, cooking, or 
  perfoming any of the other choices of possible tasks.
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>Do Not Make Up for "Lost" Time</h3>
  <br>
  The main lesson to keep in mind is that it is not possible to make up for lost time, because one can only perform tasks more efficiently or less efficiently. 
  Time management is, thereofore, a better term. When performing the same number of tasks within tighter time constraints, many things can go differently from time
  anticipated. This is especially true while driving, as the costs of making mistakes can result in far greatere consequences.
  <br>
  Instead, account for tasks that cannot be feasibly performed woithin the allotted time frame, and leave them out when possible. The main idea is to get from A to B
  safely.
